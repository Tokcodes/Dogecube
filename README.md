This is a open source game, I would like everyone in this community to tag along and see what we can create!

I made a very simple game in python and alos pygame so I have all the files in this repository; I wanted to get along and get to know this ocmmuntiy a bit more so here I am to 
see what we all can come up with maybe somone can make and educational version of this game and every time you die it ask you a question, if you get the question correct it 
will allow you to keep playing but if you get it wrong you die. This was origanly made for a school stem fair project I made but I want to see what we can do here, the judges 
came up wiht a bunch of good points like we could make a game that aks you math or english questions; cahnge the difficulty as you get further into the game. the thing that 
really set this down in my heart to do this is the fact these game dont require wifi and raspbery pi's are cheep on their own but if you get some cheap screens that are small
and buy them in bulk alnog wiht raspbery pi's we can many game installed on it and give it to less fortunate kids. And the educational game can really help them I do belive. 
So again i am encouraging you all to add your own little twist and see what we can do, if you want to show me anythnig you have done just message me on social media.
